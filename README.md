<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project, **Sports Spots in Gran Canaria**, was developed as a personal initiative to provide residents and tourists alike with a comprehensive guide to the best places for outdoor sports on the island of Gran Canaria. Whether you're into surfing, hiking, cycling, or any other activity, this webpage offers a detailed list of spots with helpful information such as location, tips, and nearby facilities.

As a student at IES El Rincón pursuing a degree in Computer Application Development (1º DAM), this project allowed me to develop my web development skills, using modern technologies and responsive design practices.
